# ðŸŸ¢ COâ‚‚ Emissions Prediction App

This Streamlit web application allows users to **predict annual COâ‚‚ emissions** from fossil fuelâ€“based power plants using a machine learning model trained on real-world data from the **U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)**.

## Project Overview

This tool estimates **COâ‚‚ emissions (in tons/year)** based on key operational parameters of a power plant, such as:

- Fuel consumption for electric generation (MMBtu)
- Total fuel consumption (MMBtu)
- Electricity generation (kWh)
- Fuel type (e.g., Natural Gas, Bituminous Coal, etc.)
- Prime mover type (e.g., Steam Turbine, Gas Turbine, etc.)

The model was trained using **measured emissions data** (not calculated) from fossil fuel power plants across the United States.

## Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Training Data Source**: [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data)
- **Model File**: `trained_pipe_co2.joblib` (stored in `model_pickle/` directory)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/co2-emissions-predictor.gitcd co2-emissions-predictor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install the required packages:

```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the App
```
bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default browser at http://localhost:8501.


## How to Use
- Enter the following inputs:
- Fuel Consumption for Electric Generation (MMBtu)
- Total Fuel Consumption (MMBtu)
- Electricity Generation (kWh)
- Fuel Code (select from dropdown)
- Prime Mover (select from dropdown)
- Click "Predict CO2 Emissions".
- The app will display the estimated COâ‚‚ emissions in tons per year.

| Fuel Code                                |NG - Natural Gas    | 
| Prime Mover                              | ST - Steam Turbine | 


## Notes
- The model is intended for educational and exploratory purposes.
- Predictions are based on historical U.S. data and may not generalize to all global contexts.
- The app uses Streamlit session state to retain user inputs and predictions across interactions.
